        <p>
          I'm a seasoned Full Stack Web Developer with a passion for crafting
          innovative and user-friendly digital solutions. With 19 years of
          hands-on experience, I have worked with JavaScript, Typescript,
          Node.js, React, Vue, PHP, Linux, and their related technologies.
        </p>

        <p>
          Throughout my career, I have successfully delivered numerous
          end-to-end web applications, employing my knowledge in both front-end
          and back-end development. I excel at creating dynamic and responsive
          user interfaces using JavaScript frameworks like React and Vue (along
          with their server side counterparts Next and Nuxt)
        </p>

        <p>
          Started working with the dawn of the dynamic web, I have seen
          everything come and pass, from the days where you had to write your
          own PHP frameworks and there was no Ajax, to our current days where JS
          actually has parallel processing and is surprisingly good for
          processing large quantities of batch data.

              Giving the "Software Engineering"class, it was an interesting
              opportunity to get out of the superficiality of PHP workshops, by
              taking my students into deeper development themes.

            <p>
              My personal pride is that even when I didn't give a deep
              'language' oriented class, my students had taken his own path in
              PHP, Ajax, CSS, MySQL, etc.. very successfully.
