      <p>
        I'm a seasoned <mark>Full Stack Web Developer</mark> with a passion for crafting
        innovative and user-friendly digital solutions. Throughout my 20 years in the industry I
        have <mark>worked with most web stacks and their related technologies</mark>.
      </p>

      <p>
        <mark>Successfully delivered numerous
          end-to-end web applications</mark>, employing my knowledge in both frontend
        and backend development. I excel at creating dynamic and responsive
        user interfaces using JavaScript frameworks like React and Vue (along
        with their server side counterparts Next and Nuxt), as well as the
        traditional API counter parts in PHP, NodeJS and Python.
      </p>

      <p>
        Started working with the dawn of the dynamic web, <mark>I have seen
          everything come and pass</mark>, from the days where you had to write your
        own PHP frameworks and there was no AJAX, to our current days where JS
        actually has parallel processing and is surprisingly good for
        dealing with large quantities of streamed data.

                <p>In this place we made the Virtual Learning Enviroment(AVA by it's spanish acronym), an ancestor of
                  the Virtual University.</p>
                <p>There I worked as the programmer in charge of the connection between the official UDG student's
                  control system (SIIAU) and AVA. Mainly automation of student's creation inside AVA, using PHP scripts
                  to extract, clean and order the information of the first system in ORACLE into the second in MySQL.
                  (with the occasional report creating, given that I already had the connection with the official system
                  and the much needed understanding of the database structure)</p>
                <p>My second project there, was the one that allowed servers with our software communicate using SOAP
                  with a intermediate layer on encryption using GPG.</p>
